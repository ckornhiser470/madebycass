    I have been drawn to critical thinking, probleming solving, and challenges
    my entire life, solidified by my degree in Applied Mathematics. That being
    said, I would consider myself a life-long visual artist as well, where
    portraits and collages have become two of my most favorite things to create.
    Wondering how I could express myself creatively while all the long feeding
    my technical appetite, I discovered coding and the infinite possibilities it
    provides for innovation, exploration, and expression.

    I truly enjoy all stages of development and production, from configuring
    backend functionality to transforming a blank HTML page into something
    beautiful and user friendly. At the moment, I am focusing on using my skills
    as a MERN stack developer, all the while wondering how to push beyond my
    limits next.
